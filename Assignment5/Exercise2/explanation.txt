I have created an assembly code that prints what I desire and tries to call transfer_money.I got the binary code of it using godbolt.com . Then I inserted my shellcode to begining of my code and filled the rest of the input with "A" until it overflows. As my input overflows the buffer I inserted the address of the buffer that makes the shellcode starts since my shellcode is at the start of the input. I got the buffer address from the gdb but since running the code in gdb and from output gives different addresses I got the address from the code by printing it. I still need to update the address for successful injection. I have no idea why I cannot call transfer_money though.
