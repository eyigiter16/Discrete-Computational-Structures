Inside the code initially there was a buffer with 100 character input. The problem was C is not checking for boundaries automatically and without checking the boundaries, scanf function can be manupulated easily. We needed to check for boundaries in buffers so that the code is more secured. We can do this checking with a simple if statement that checks the size of the buffer or we can use a function that does this itself. However we would need other functions than c standart library which lacks of security such as bound checks.
