struct uses contiguous memory in according to find the desired member faster. But if we dpnt use struct, the memory would be non-contiguous which makes the accessing desired memory slower. However since we use struct overwriteing memory is easier. If we overflow the username buffer more than its size plus the check_pin's size, because of contiguous memory allocation, check_pin would be overwritten as well.
